I(identify):
  The Problem is when a given input is either in double or integer so for example, "2, 10" the 2 becomes the integer and the 10 is
  the power resulting like this 2^10. 

D(define):
  The goal of this problem is that we have to get the power of the given integer either in double or integer. To have this goal we may have
  to get another method in double to return the power.

E(Explore):
  I just came up with one solution with this problem, in which, is making another method over another method to return "If(n %2==0) return y*y".
  In the end it will show that the method was doned to retunr the power of x^n.
A(Act):
  To anticipate possible outcomes I created a method to have if n == 0 to return 1. Also, anothe is to have n is equal or greater from 0.
  Those are the only possible outcomes since it should work with negative numbers.
L(Look and Learn):
  In this problem I learned that I can split the job when calling another method within another method to make easier.
