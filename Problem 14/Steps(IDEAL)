I(Identify): 
  In this problem we have to find the closest sum of the targeted number. After picking a target as a number, we have to get
  sum of the closest number of the list or array.
D(Define):
  The goal of the this exercise is to have the sum of the closest to the target starting from the left to right .
E(Explore):
  The solution that I came up with is having the arrays being sorted and then starting from the left to right of the while
  we get the summation of the sum closest to the target. Based on the examples, it starts from the left to right so that is the reason
  I based on the starting point then have a summation of closest to the target.
A(Act):
  Some outcomes of the code were thinking in case the length of the array or list was too short or even null.
L(Look and Learn):
  I learned on this problem so much complexity based on the logic on the example to try not to think logically and force it 
  into coding. I learned to see the outcomes in case the list was too short.
