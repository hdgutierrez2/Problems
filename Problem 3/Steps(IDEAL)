#Steps

I(Identify):
  We have to identify that depending on the Nth node we have to take out of the list given by the linked list.

D(Define your goal):
  To define our goal we have to see that the problem is asking of a linked list. Also, depending on the Nth node it will skip it.

E(Explore):
  The only way to do the this problemis linked list based on the details of the problem. The linked list can be either doned by a
  for loop, recursive. The recursive is much simple than the for loop because it provides several steps before it skips the Nth node.
 
A(Act):
  The act of anticipating outcomes can be only done when head is equal to null, or the next is equal to null.

L(Look and Learn):
  I learned that the problem can be doned by the for loop also but more complicated then the recursive form. It is pretty basic, problem
  when having to see the linked list.
