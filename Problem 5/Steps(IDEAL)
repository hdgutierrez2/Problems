I(Identify):
  To identify the problem we have to look for the largest number of the array and put first and then second one and so on. That is the
  solution we have to look for since the problem can be multiple array numbers.
  
D(Define):
  To define our problem we have to get the largest number and put it first then the second most largest number and so on. The goal is 
  simple but it is diffcult since it has to be a for loop comparing it and print it again and again.

E(explore);
  The only solution that I could came up with is it converted to string then usea a comparator to decide which string should come
  first and then reverse so we can append. Finally do the edge cases when your array has bunch of zeros.

A(Act):
  To ancipate the possible outcomes it was just in case the number was a given 0. Also, if the number is number is null or the length 
  of the array equals to null.

L(Look and Learn):
  I learned to use a comparator so it can decide which string should come first in concatenation and to learn to append it.Some of the 
  operations were not known by me since I havent learned any of them.
