#Steps
Container with the Most Water

I(Identify):
  First step is to identify the problem in which the it states that we have to pick the maximum amount with most water on the
  graph.
  
D(Define your goal):
  Second step is to define the problem to were we want to go or in other words the solution. The solution has to be with the maximum
  amount of water which includes the area and you have to explored multiple solutions to get the maximum area given in the array.
  
E(Explore solutions):
  The third is to explored solutions in which by exploring in this problem it can be doned by brute force or either it can be doned by
  having 2 pointer in which you can comper the solution in a while. The brute force is in which you have a double a for loop as well 
  compare both answers. I disliked the brute force in this case since it is more confusing with for loops and its time complexity
  is O(n^2). Instead the two pointers approach has has only a while and the time complexity is O(n), in which, I picked or my
  reference.

A(Act):
  The fourth is to check if the soltion works in every occasion, for example, null, -1, Double, decimal, String(when asking for a number)
  and if the  number is to large.

L(Look and Learn):
  The fifth step is to learn that when taking a problem is to see the math first. For instance, in this problem you had to use math 
  to get the area and compare each one to get the biggest container. So in a way for get the area is to do the while and compare is 
  the if to compare each one to get the biggest one.
