I(Identify):
  We need to find the duplicated number of the given array. After finding the duplicate number the output has to be given on the 
  position of the array.
 
D(Define):
  Our goal is to give the position of the output. In a way we have to sort the array compare the numbers of the array and 
  return the biggest array.

E(Explore):
  Some of the solutions were using sorting the array to compare it the numbers of the array. Also, anothr approach was is to set in 
  which it stores each element as it iterates over the array.
  
A(Act):
  To anticipate some of the problems is to check if the problem has more than 1 duplicate or if the number is positive or negative.
  
L(Look and Learn):
  The one thing I learned of the problem is using array sort. It is easier sometimes to sort the array and compare it to get the 
  position of the largest or smallest number of the given array.
