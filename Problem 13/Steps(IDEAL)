I(Identify):
  The problem is asking how many steps does the robot needs to take dependind on the grid(m x n). We have to find the multiple 
  patterns of the robot depending on the grid.
D(Define):
  The goal is to have 2D array which saves the pattern of the robot when taking a step depending on the grid. In this case the grid is 
  7 x 3(m x n).
E(Explore):
  The only way that I could come up is to think of the 2D array in which saves the position either right or down.The first is to create
  multiple for loops to go to the right or down. Also, to do another for loops to give out the final cordinates of the robot did.
A(Act):
  The only possible outcomes that I could thinkg is if the grid is 0 x 0 or 1 x 1 in which the answer would be null.
L(Look and Learn):
  I learned of the 2D arrays method when having board or grid is usefull. I didnt rememeber so much of the 2D arrays since we havent used them 
  in a long time but with practice it good to remember a little.
