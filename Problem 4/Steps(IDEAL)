I(Identify):
  To identify the problem we have to have to make the program choose the number that is non repeated from the other numbers given.
  
D(Define your goal):
  To define your goal we understand that we have to pick the number that is not repeated. Our goal is to find that single one.

E(Explore):
  To explore the problem we have to see multiple solutions. One of them is to do an linked list with the arrays or continue with working 
  with arrays. The one I choosed is to sort out the arrays  then mulitple ifs out and in the for loop to take out some cases. During, the
  for loop I compared 2 cases which return the number of the array that is not repeated.

A(Act):
  To see some of the cases that anticipared outcomes is if the array length is equal to 1 or if their isnt repeated numbers between
  the array.
  
L(Look and Learn):
  I learned that the single number can be doned with the linked list which sounds complicated but it is possible based on the multiple
  numbers given in the array. If next time I will use the "Arrays.sort" then use the for loop.
