I(identify):
  The problem is idicating that wants to rotate it 90 degrees. Also, the matrix can be doned by n*n which means
  a 2D arrays that have the same length and heigth.
D(define):
  To defineour goal of the problem we want to get to the part were we have to transpose then swaping the array. Also, after swaping
  the array it will have to flip again horzontally to get to out goal.

E(Explore):
  To make it rotate 90 degrees the easiest way to do it is to transpose and interchange the matrix [row][col] to matrix[col][row].
  After doing the transpose reverse the rows by parsing from start until middle index.
A(Act):
To anticipate any possible outcomes can only be doned when the array isnt n*n. In other words, when 2D array isnt the same number of
rows and columbs.

L(Look and Learn):
  I learned that instead doing everything in one for loop, you can do it in multiple for loops by doing the transpose, swaping and 
  reverse.
